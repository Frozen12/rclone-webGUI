/* This file can be used for custom CSS or for Tailwind JIT/build output */
/* For simplicity, we are using Tailwind CDN directly in HTML templates. */
/* If you want to build Tailwind locally, you would compile your Tailwind
   classes into this file. Example for a build:
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
